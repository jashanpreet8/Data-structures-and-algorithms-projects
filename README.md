# CP164 - Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains my assignments, labs, midterm, and final projects completed as part of the CP164 course. CP164 is an introductory
course designed to introduce students to data structures and their applications, including recursion, searching, sorting, queues, stacks,
heaps, and the analysis of algorithms using big "O" notation.

## Repository Structure  
__Assignments:__ All assignments completed for the course.  
__Labs:__ Laboratory exercises completed during the course.  
__jash6749_data_structures:__ Contains all data structures implemented for use in assignments and labs.  
__Midterm:__ Midterm project.  
__Final:__ Final project.

## Naming Convention  
Assignments and labs in this repository follow a specific naming convention:  
__'jash6749'__ represents my login.  
__'a'__ indicates an assignment followed by assignment number.  
__'l'__ indicates a lab followed by lab number.  

## Task Specification  
Under each assignment and lab directory, different functions are specified as tasks (__'t01'__, __'t02'__, etc.). Each task 
represents a specific programming challenge or requirement to be implemented.

## Grade  
I am proud to mention that I achieved an A+ grade in this course.
